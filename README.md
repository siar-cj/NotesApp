## Usage

The application provides a simple command-line interface with a menu-based navigation system. You can navigate through the different options using the arrow keys and press Enter to select an option.

Once you have launched the application, you can use the following commands:

- **Create a new note:** Select the "Create a New Note" option from the main menu. You will be prompted to enter a title and contents for your note.

- **View a specific note:** Select the "View Note Details" option from the main menu, and then choose the note you want to view.

- **Edit a note:** Choose the "Edit Note" option from the main menu, and then select the note you want to edit. You can modify the contents of the note and save your changes.

- **Delete a note:** Select the "Delete Note" option from the main menu, and then choose the note you want to delete. Confirm your action, and the note will be permanently removed.

- **Save and load notes:** The application automatically saves your notes to a local file called "notes.txt" whenever you create, edit, or delete a note. When you relaunch the application, it loads the existing notes from the file.
